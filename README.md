# Building an html file
Before building make sure you have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.<br>
To build an html file with windows use 
`build_win.bat`<br>
To build an html file with linux (*and possibly macintosh?*) use
`build_lin.sh`<br>
## Where does it appear?
The built file should appear in a Build folder that will contain a file with the UTC timestamp and the Name you put in!
